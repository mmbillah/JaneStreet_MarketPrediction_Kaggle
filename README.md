A self-ventured project to apply predictive modeling on the trading decisions to maximize the return based on real global stock exchange data. Trained RNN, LSTM models on time series data (real stock market data consisting 2.39M tradings and 130 features) to maximize AUC. Achieved high utility score (weighted ROI) by testing on future data. Received bronze medal in the associated Kaggle competition lauched by Jane Street (2021).
